# DevOps Testbed

## Motivation
Every piece of of software you interact with online is developed, tested, configured, deployed, monitored, and scaled up. Heroku simplifies many aspects of this significantly, which is awesome for new developers that want to get their apps online as quickly as possible. In the industry, however, many of these simplifications and shortcuts come at a significant speed and resource cost and more ‘industrial grade’ solutions are required.

This collection of projects covers fundamentals and tools of the trade to better lead my future teams in every aspect of the software development and deployment cycle using the industrial best practices.
